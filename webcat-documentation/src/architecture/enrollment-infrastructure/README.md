# Enrollment Infrastructure

The WEBCAT enrollment infrastructure is a distributed system, designed to reduce censorship risks and avoid single points of trust or failure.

Also see a specification of the full process [here](https://github.com/freedomofpress/webcat-spec/blob/main/enrollment.md).

For sequence diagrams of the enrollment flow and oracle/validator communication, see [webcat-infra-chain docs](https://github.com/freedomofpress/webcat-infra-chain/blob/main/docs/seq_diag.md).
