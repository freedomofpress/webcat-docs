# Examples
We have tentatively ported a feww selected open-source web application to prove their potential compatibility with WEBCAT. No official support is provided, as such, administrators as discouraged from deploying them without prior testing, and understandinf that updates might be breaking, or require significant additional work.

TODO: remove the examples from the main WEBCAT repo and move them here. Update the command line from the old signing script to the new webcat-cli.

### Test App

### Jitsi

### Element

### Globaleaks

### Bitwarden

### Cryptpad
