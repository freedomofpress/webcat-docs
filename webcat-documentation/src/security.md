# Security
WEBCAT is currently in an alpha stage, as such it might be instable. Furthermore, it has not been audited, and its experimental nature may carry risks.

We have spent considerable effort in ensuring the WEBCAT browser extension does not lower the security posture of any user's browser. 

## Report a vulnerability
To report a vulnerability affecting any of the system components, please write an email to [webcat@freedomp.press](mailto:webcat@freedom.press). As an alternative, we also welcome reports via the Github Security reporting feature in each corresponding repository. We take security seriously, and we will do out best to timnely address any issue, and disclose it.
